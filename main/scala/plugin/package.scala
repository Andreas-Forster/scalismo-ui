/**
 * This package is meant to simulate "external project" development, for instance for plugins.
 * It intentionally has a "non-scalismo" package name, because external projects are not supposed to use the scalismo namespace.
 *
 * The reason it's here is that working with multiple projects at the same time and keeping them in sync
 * is a pain in the butt.
 *
 * This package will most probably go away once the refactoring is done.
